## Python toys?

Just having fun, was watching matrix, and stared to toy around with some
console output.

vert_sin_moving_string: writing a string horizontally along a right justified path?

All this very rough.

I have an idea that the flow is like a stream ...
and now I want to create a rock in the middle of the stream, so will have to show
some type of disruption, along with the stone not moving ...


Turtle examples.
================

graphic_sine is another sine example, another in progress mini-proj



should be fun!

Enjoy.
